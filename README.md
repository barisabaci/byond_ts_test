Problem solving on timeseries/regression for B-YOND DS Candidates

This document is intended for timeseries/regression problem solving on 3 features using ts_test_43.csv.

Description:

In this experiment , you are expected to predict 3 features Val_1, Val_2,Val_3  for  next 4 sequence in the given series. MAPE will be used to measure of modelâ€™s succes. Keep in mind these values have interdependency  between each other.

	Data
	43 Samples, 4 columns ,  data is sorted
	Index:Index of row 
	Val_1: Numeric 
	Val_2: Numeric
	Val_3: Numeric

	Submission
	In the submitted file you should add 
	1- Documentation of experiment including hardware , software ,cpu/gpu runtime information
	2- Code snippet
	3- 4 predictions for each feature in csv file formatted below

	Sample:
	Index,Val_1,Val_2,Val_3
	44;15,481;8,615;24,684
	45;29,798;5,401;35,222
	46;33,705;5,670;42,900
